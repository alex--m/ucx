/**
 * @ingroup UCB_CONTEXT
 * @brief UCB Application Context
 *
 * UCB application context (or just a context) is an opaque handle that holds a
 * UCB communication instance's global information.  It represents a single UCB
 * communication instance.  The communication instance could be an OS process
 * (an application) that uses UCP library.  This global information includes
 * communication resources, endpoints, memory, temporary worker storage, and
 * other communication information directly associated with a specific UCB
 * instance.  The context also acts as an isolation mechanism, allowing
 * resources associated with the context to manage multiple concurrent
 * communication instances. For example, users using both MPI and OpenSHMEM
 * sessions simultaneously can isolate their communication by allocating and
 * using separate contexts for each of them. Alternatively, users can share the
 * communication resources (memory, network resource context, etc.) between
 * them by using the same application context. A message sent or a RMA
 * operation performed in one application context cannot be received in any
 * other application context.

 * perform this batch operation once. The description holds all the
 * necessary information to perform this read/write, so re-starting an
 * operation requires no additional parameters.
